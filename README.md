# Programming-2020
This is the repository for the 2020 season of FRC
Lets see how this goes!

## Run down of how GitHub works
- Create a new branch of the master branch: This will be your way of making changes to the program
- After you save your changes, try running the program on the robot before merging with the master
- Use Git Bash to save a repository to a local computer. Or you can be lame and download the zip.
- If you download the zip, you have to make it into a branch of the master and merge it. You need to use Git Bash for this

### If you have questions, consult the internet. That's the easiest and fastest way to solve your problems

This is the easiest way to work in a team for programming believe it or not
